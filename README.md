# Finance Challenge
As part of the DS4A Fellowship, I created a Fraud Dashboard from a dataset containing ~6.7 million rows of data. I first conducted an EDA on Jupyter Notebooks with the python pandas library, conducted data cleaning on Dataiku DSS, then imported the data to Tableau to create the visualization.

This repository contains:
- Statistics Charts
- Jupypter Notebook EDA
- Tableau Views
